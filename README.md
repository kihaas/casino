# Casino

An exciting full-stack **web-based casino** project featuring both `frontend` and `backend` modules. This project delivers interactive casino-style gameplay, complete with essential game logic, user interfaces, and real-time engagement—all implemented as a comprehensive showcase of modern web development skills.

##  Project Overview

This project is structured into two main parts:

- `backend`: Contains server logic, game rules, user handling, and APIs.
- `frontend`: Hosts the client-side interface—responsible for UI and user interactions.

Together, they form a coherent online casino experience suitable for showcasing proficiency in full-stack development.

##  Features (Example Highlights)

- **Multiple casino games** — e.g., slots, dice, roulette, or card games (customize based on actual content).
- **User interactions** — login, play, and real-time results.
- **Game validation** — secure server-side verification of bets and payouts.
- **Responsive frontend** — mobile-friendly design and intuitive UX.
- **Separated architecture** — clear API boundaries for scalability and maintainability.
